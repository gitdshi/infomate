# Why InfoMate?

As information is much more easier for people to acquire since technology continuously evolved and many information generated on Web 2.0 platforms.
Everyone get their brain overloaded to memorize all the information they have been processed.
So an AI-assistant is people want to have as their 2nd brain as their personal needs to be equiped with all the information that they can get.
However, the general AI services is not able to provide your personalized information, due to data privacy and other reasons.
Thanks to NextCloud that everyone can have a central place to store all the personal information privately including documentation, files, data, pictures and others.
